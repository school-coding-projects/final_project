# **CSE 212 Tutorial**

Welcome to the Programming with Data Structures Tutorial. Every Python programmer should understand these topics:

- [Stack](1-stack.md)
- [Set](2-set.md)
- [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
